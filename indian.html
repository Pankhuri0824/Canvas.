Aware of Krishna’s godly qualities Radha has the pooja thali, the platter of flowers and sweetmeats near her, the ritual of worship and adulation to be completed before the love play starts. Human and godly loves are combined in this relationship.

During this period, the entire country was bursting with rage after the partition of the important cultural, political, and economic center- Bengal, in 1905. However, this painting that became a symbol of the nationalist movement and inspired more recreations to instill patriotism amongst the citizens was not meant to be called `Bharat Mata` initially. In fact, Tagore wanted it to be an ode to the Bengali women and hence, wanted to call it “Bongo Mata” as a symbol of women empowerment.<br><br> Bharat Mata, created by Abanindranath Tagore is unique in every aspect. Unlike popular Indian goddesses, Bharat Mata, represented by Tagore, is a simple yet godly young woman clad in a plain saffron saree draped in the Bengali style. Even though she is absolutely unembellished, she radiates immense beauty. Here, she does not look like a goddess, but a simple traditional Indian woman. It is her multiple hands and the halo around her head that gives her a divine appearance. In her four hands, she holds a Rudraksha mala, a white cloth, sheaves of paddy, and a palm leaf manuscript. .Tagore’s Bharat Mata is a personification of India’s rich economy and cultural heritage.','photos/bharat.jpg')">
